# Bienvenue sur Le Lobby

The Lobby platform is developed as part of The Hacking Project session 11 (winter 2020) Final Project.
The team consists of Agathe Plunian, Amine Amarouche, Axel Aidan, Daniel Venera, Mathieu Lasserre and Nicolas Chattour.

The project is developed under rails Rails 5.2.4.1.

This is the first version of the site. It is set to be improved in the coming weeks.

Who we are:

- a platform bringing together ecological movements, currently confined to the little gestures of daily life
- a platform allowing you as a visitor or as a user to send us your suggestions
- a non-profit association law project of 1901 under development
- a student project in the field of web development


What we aspire to be:

- a non-profit 1901 french law association
- an ecology-oriented platform fully open to consultation without advertising
- a platform centralizing the information provided by the media we choose
- an exchange and proposal platform via a system of Forums and Events
- a platform offering lobbying actions to the legislator, proposals submitted to the vote of users and members

What we are not:

- a company
- a lobby defending private or commercial interests
- a social network reselling the information of its users
- a simple student project: we want to develop and support this network beyond our training
